         *
         *     This endpoint provides comprehensive statistics about the entire card catalog database.
         *
         *     **Purpose:**
         *     Collectors can view high-level metrics to understand the scope and breadth of the CardSight AI catalog. This helps inform collecting strategies by showing:
         *     - What segments and manufacturers are available
         *     - How many releases exist per year
         *     - The depth of card data (base cards vs parallels vs variations)
         *     - AI identification capabilities
         *
         *     **Response Structure:**
         *
         *     **Segments:**
         *     - Total count of sports/card segments
         *     - Breakdown showing each segment name with release count
         *
         *     **Manufacturers:**
         *     - Total count of card manufacturers
         *     - All manufacturers with their release counts
         *
         *     **Releases:**
         *     - Total count across all years
         *     - Breakdown by segment with total releases per segment
         *     - Within each segment, year-by-year breakdown of release counts
         *
         *     **Sets:**
         *     - Total count of card sets
         *     - Count of identifiable sets (sets that can be recognized by AI)
         *
         *     **Cards:**
         *     - Total count of all cards in catalog
         *     - Count of base cards (original cards)
         *     - Count of variations (alternate versions of base cards)
         *
         *     **Parallels:**
         *     - Total count of parallel types
         *     - Count of full set parallels (apply to entire set)
         *     - Count of partial parallels (apply to specific cards only)
         *
         *     **Caching:**
         *     This endpoint is cached for 1 hour to optimize performance since catalog statistics change infrequently.
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - Understanding catalog coverage before starting a collection
         *     - Identifying which manufacturers have the most complete data
         *     - Seeing historical trends in releases by year
         *     - Gauging AI identification capabilities for specific sets

         * @description Track progress toward completing a specific parallel variant within a set.
         *
         *     This endpoint tracks completion for a specific parallel (e.g., all Refractors, all Gold parallels) within a set. Unlike the base set progress endpoint which counts any parallel as complete, this endpoint only counts cards where you own the specific parallel variant.
         *
         *     **Path Parameters:**
         *     - **collectionId**: UUID of the collection to analyze
         *     - **setId**: UUID of the set to check progress for
         *     - **parallelId**: UUID of the specific parallel variant (e.g., Refractor, Gold, Silver, Prizm, etc.)
         *
         *     **Response includes:**
         *     - Set name, release name, and release year for context
         *     - Parallel name (e.g., "Refractor", "Gold Prizm")
         *     - Total cards in set vs owned cards of this specific parallel
         *     - Completion percentage for this parallel variant (0-100)
         *     - Array of missing card UUIDs for this parallel (for targeted buying)
         *     - Estimated cost to complete this parallel variant (based on raw card prices)
         *     - Average card value for this parallel
         *
         *     **How it differs from base set progress:**
         *     - **Base set progress** (/set-progress/:setId): Counts card #5 as owned if you have ANY parallel (base, refractor, gold, etc.)
         *     - **Parallel set progress** (this endpoint): Only counts card #5 if you own it as THIS specific parallel
         *
         *     **Use Cases:**
         *     - Track completion of premium parallel sets (Refractors, numbered parallels)
         *     - Calculate exact cost to complete a specific parallel run
         *     - Focus buying decisions on specific parallel variants
         *     - Chase rare parallel variations (e.g., Gold /10, Orange /25)
         *     - Investment tracking for high-value parallels
         *     - Set collection goals for parallel variants
         *
         *     **Example Scenario:**
         *     You're collecting all Refractor parallels from 2023 Prizm Basketball Base Set. You own 187 of 250 Refractors. This endpoint returns:
         *     - 74.8% complete
         *     - List of 63 missing Refractor card UUIDs
         *     - Estimated $1,247.50 to complete the Refractor parallel set
         *
         *     **Important Notes:**
         *     - Only base cards are considered (card variations where baseCardId IS NOT NULL are excluded)
         *     - Filters collection_cards by the specific parallelId provided
         *     - Estimated costs are based on raw (ungraded) card prices for this parallel
         *     - Returns 404 if parallel doesn't belong to the specified set
         *     - Missing cards are returned as UUIDs for easy lookup via the catalog API
